[Work in Progress]

## Description
This is a simple puzzle platformer where there is a ball that move horizontal automatically. When the ball hit a wall, the ball will change its direction. From right to left, from left to right. 

You as the player can only control the ball by using jump with a tap. Avoid obstacle and go to designated marker to win the game.

## Project
Open using Unity 2021.3.12f1, open Game scene and press Play. It will automatically load level 16. You can change game level from Stage Config file.

The ball will move automatically. Press space to jump. Still work in progress. Currently can only move, bounce, jump, and die. When die it will respawn after 1-2 second delay.

This is my attempt to remake my old game that I created when in college. That project is still exist but cannot be build.
